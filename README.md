I have set out to make a "jekyll" like kind of blogging system that is entirelly static and utilizes the gods of webpack to compile the markdown files and organize them to where they need to be organized via dates.

This is my personal blog site, feel free to clone it and style it to your liking, this project uses emotion for the styling of the components.
